[To Do]
- Fix MP heal bug; After using skills that drain MP, the MP passive heal will regenerate to the original MP + 3. Ex: 3000MP - 1000MP (skill use) then heals to 3003, not 2003.
- Add a functionality that will not overwrite buffs if the former buff values are higher
- Sniff and fix guild expand packets, new guild creation packets, guild BBS packets, and guild skill packets
- Fix characters not able to rejoin a guild after leaving or being expelled
- Fix char spawn stance; Not really a big deal.
- Fix character creation for other classes
- Fix MP heal over time
- Refine monster controllers/spawn
- Fix reactor; need to add char ID to packet structure
- Add MapleTalk Server

[Gameplay/Scripting To Do]
- Reactor at "Inside the Dangerous Forest" 4000014 doesn't drop "First Explorer Gift Box" 4033915
- Reactor at "Southperry" 4000030 doesn't drop "Boat Boarding Ticket" 4033914

[Notes]
- Mobs spawn functionality is buggy. Mobs that were previously spawned, freeze when a player re-enters the map.
- When there are more than two players in the map, mobs' movement becomes buggy and teleports around the map. I suspect this is because when one mob leaves one player's view while it's still in shown in another player's view, the syncing between this event is wrong and causes mobs to teleport. I've deduced that it has something to do with managing monster controllers.
- Chat handling is different from Nexon's. Have to code a MapleTalk server in order for buddychat and guildchat to work.
- When new players spawn into a map with existing players, the former views the latter in the jump state. 
- When creating a guild, the GuildPacket.newGuildInfo() is wrong so it doesn't refresh the guild. You'd have to change channels or relog to see the guild. This is fixable by sending the correct packet, however I forgot to save the guild creation packets.
- When attempting to change Guild Rank Titles, pressing save shows a "It cannot be used. Please check it again." message in the client.

[Rev 6]
- Updated source for Netty implementation

[Rev 5.3]
- Added MapleExp & MapleExpStatus class; Added for clean object and structural organization
- Added proper CWvsContext.InfoPacket.gainExpMessage(); This fixes exp status messages not showing anymore than 1 line and GMS like.
- Added PacketHelper.writeExpMask()
- Added MapleMonster.calculateBlessedEnsembleExp(); Doesn't do anything yet.
- Updated DamageParse.applyMagicAttack(); This allows active skills to apply monster statuses.
- Updated PartyOperationHandler party invitation case; This fixes an overlooked NullPointerException.
- Updated MapleBuffStat ELEMENT_RESET

[Rev 5.2]
- Added MapleCharacter.cancelBlessedEnsemble() to MapleClient.removeTask(); This fixes Blessed Ensemble still running after the player has logged off.
- Added World.updateBlessedEnsemble() to World.updateParty(); This fixes Blessed Ensemble handling when party members join/leave the party.
- Added Skills class constants; Hopefully this structure and design pattern clears ambiguous variables and values. Will eventually add every skill as we come across/need them.
- Added Jobs class constants; Again, hopefully this helps with structure and design.
- Updated MagicianBuff Bless, Divine Protection, Advanced Blessing; They should read the correct buffstat value now.
- Updated RecvPacketOpcode NPC_ACTION, ITEM_PICKUP
- Updated PlayerStats passive skills and renamed alot of ugly/ambiguous variables. The skill changelog can be found here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y04Qo8GXhkjTNaPosEWp95YJ-Ygm0C4slxMzmzeGk5k/edit?usp=sharing

[Rev 5.1]
- Updated MapleGuild & MapleGuildCharacter; Fixed an issue where individualGP was not being loaded from the database.
- Added Blessed Ensemble and Blessed Harmony; This is a more proper implementation which includes the use of Timer. It currently works for all cases except for when there are two Bishops in the party, and when you reinvite a party member that already had your buff; the latter is easily fixed by rebuffing. The current working cases are 1) buffing party members, 2) cancelling owner and party members' buffs, and 3) party member leaving. There is a bug in which the Timer does not cancel if the player quits the game.

[Rev 5]
